Gardener implements the automated management and operation of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) clusters as a service and provides support for multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack). Its main principle is to leverage Kubernetes concepts for all of its tasks.

In essence, Gardener is an [extension API server](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/setup-extension-api-server/) that comes along with a bundle of custom controllers. It introduces new API objects in an existing Kubernetes cluster (which is called **garden** cluster) in order to use them for the management of end-user Kubernetes clusters (which are called **shoot** clusters). These shoot clusters are described via [declarative cluster specifications](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot-aws.yaml) which are observed by the controllers. They will bring up the clusters, reconcile their state, perform automated updates and make sure they are always up and running.

To accomplish these tasks reliably and to offer a certain quality of service, Gardener requires to control the main components of a Kubernetes cluster (etcd, API server, controller manager, scheduler). These so-called *control plane* components are hosted in Kubernetes clusters themselves (which are called **seed** clusters). This is the main difference compared to many other OSS cluster provisioning tools: The shoot clusters do not have dedicated master VMs, instead, the control plane is deployed as native Kubernetes workload into the seeds. This does not only effectively reducing the total costs of ownership, it also allows easier implementations for "day-2 operations" (like cluster updates or robustness) by relying on all the mature Kubernetes features and capabilities.

Please find more information regarding the concepts and a detailed description of the architecture in our [Gardener Wiki](https://github.com/gardener/documentation/wiki/Architecture) and our [blog post on kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/05/17/gardener/).

## To start using or developing the Gardener locally

See our documentation in the `/docs` repository, please [find the index here](docs/README.md).

## Setting up your own Gardener landscape in the cloud

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster then please take a look at our [Gardener Helm Chart](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/tree/master/charts/gardener). If you don't have a cluster into which you could deploy Gardener then play around with our [landscape setup](https://github.com/gardener/landscape-setup). This will bootstrap a fresh Kubernetes cluster, and it installs your own Gardener system into it (including our pre-configured [Gardener Dashboard](https://github.com/gardener/dashboard)).

## Feedback and Support

Feedback and contributions are always welcome. Please report bugs or suggestions about our Kubernetes clusters as such or the Gardener itself as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/issues) or join our [Slack channel #gardener](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/gardener) (please invite yourself to the Kubernetes workspace [here](http://slack.k8s.io)).
