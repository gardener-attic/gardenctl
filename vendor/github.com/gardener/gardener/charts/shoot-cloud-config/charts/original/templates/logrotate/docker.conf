# Configure log rotation for all logs in /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log, which is where docker containers
# are configured to write their log files. Whenever logrotate is ran, this
# config will:
# * rotate the log file if its size is > 200Mb OR if one day has elapsed
# * save rotated logs into a gzipped timestamped backup
# * log file timestamp (controlled by 'dateformat') includes seconds too. This
#   ensures that logrotate can generate unique logfiles during each rotation
#   (otherwise it skips rotation if 'maxsize' is reached multiple times in a
#   day).
# * keep only 14 old (rotated) logs, and will discard older logs.
