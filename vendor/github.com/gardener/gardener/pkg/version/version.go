package version

// Version is a global variable which is set during compile time via -ld-flags in the `go build` process.
// It stores the version of the Gardener and has either the form <X> or <X.Y>, where <X> denominates
// the current 'major' version, and <Y> (if present) denominates the current 'hotfix' version.
var Version = "binary was not built properly"
