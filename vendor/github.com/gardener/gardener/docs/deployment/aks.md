# Deploying the Gardener and a Seed into an AKS cluster

This document demonstrates how to install Gardener into an existing
AKS cluster. We'll use a single cluster for the sake of simplicity to
host both Gardener and a seed to the same cluster.

Please note that this document is to provide you an example
installation and is not to be used in a production environment since
there are some certificates hardcoded, non-HA and non-TLS-enabled etcd
setup.

# Prerequisites

Summary of prerequisites:
- An Azure AKS cluster with:
  - default ClusterRoles defined (not defined by default since RBAC is not enabled),
  - Tiller deployed with `cluster-admin` ClusterRole,
  - stable/nginx-ingress Helm chart deployed,
  - a wildcard DNS record pointing the ingress,
  - `az` command line client configured for related subscription,
- An Azure service principle to provide Azure credentials to Gardener,
- A Route53 Hosted Zone and AWS account credentials with permissions on that Route53 Zone,
  - `aws` command line client configured for this account,
- `gardenctl` command line client configured for the AKS cluster's kubeconfig

**Note**: We use a Route53 Hosted Zone even if we are deploying on Azure, this is due
to lack of Azure DNS implementation in Gardener, it only supports
aws-route53 or google-clouddns for now.

## AWS credentials for Route 53 Hosted Zone

You need to provide credentials for AWS with permission to access Route53
Hosted Zone. In this example we'll assume your domain for the Hosted
Zone is `.your.domain.here`.

```
HOSTED_ZONE_ID=        # place your AWS Route53 hostedZoneID here
```

Create an AWS user, define policy to allow permission for the Hosted
Zone and note the `hostedZoneID`, `accessKeyID` and `secretAccessKey`
for later use.

## Deploy AKS cluster

Here you can find a summary for creating an AKS cluster, if you already
have one, skip this. You can **skip the Azure HTTP addons** when
installing the AKS cluster, we'll install stable/nginx-ingress Helm chart as
you can see below.

```
az group create --name garden-1 --location eastus
az aks create --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 --node-count 3 --generate-ssh-keys -s Standard_DS4_v2
az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1
```

### Install default ClusterRoles

On Azure, RBAC support is planned for GA and not enabled yet, so
ClusterRole definitions are not in place and this causes Gardener Helm
chart to fail. Below instead of removing RBAC support from Gardener
installation we are faking the RBAC support by manually creating ClusterRoles
on our AKS cluster.

**Note**: We are using v1.9.6 in our AKS cluster, mind the version in
the url below and please use the rules for the right version.

```
# manually create ClusterRoles in AKS, required until RBAC support is added to AKS
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/v1.9.6/plugin/pkg/auth/authorizer/rbac/bootstrappolicy/testdata/cluster-roles.yaml --validate=false
```

### Install Tiller to AKS

Helm must run with a ClusterRole (`cluster-admin`) with enough
permissions even if RBAC is not enabled, this is an enforcement needs
to be addressed on Helm side not on AKS/Kubernetes. So let's create a
Tiller ServiceAccount with `cluster-admin` ClusterRole and deploy it:
([`example/aks/tiller-rbac-config.yaml`](../../example/aks/tiller-rbac-config.yaml)).

```
# Reference: https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/rbac.md
kubectl apply -f example/aks/tiller-rbac-config.yaml
helm init --service-account tiller
```

### Deploy stable/nginx-ingress chart to AKS

At the moment all `Ingress` resources created by the Gardener are
using the nginx annotations. This is the simplest solution at the
moment, because it works across cloud providers. But in the future
it's planned to make it more customizable.

[AKS Ingress](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/ingress)
documentation tells about installing Ingress controller with RBAC
disabled, you can also follow that one but since we already deployed
the default ClusterRoles above, we are now able to install the chart
with RBAC enabled.

```
helm upgrade --install --namespace kube-system nginx-ingress stable/nginx-ingress
```

### Create wildcard DNS record for the ingress

You need to pick a wildcard subdomain matching your Route53 Hosted
Zone here. This ingress wildcard record is supposed to be part of the Seed
cluster rather than Gardener cluster, in our example we'll use
`*.seed-1.your.domain.here`.

Assuming you have the AWS cli for your Route53 Hosted Zone is
configured on your local, here we'll create the wildcard DNS record
using the [`awless`](http://awless.io/). You can also use the AWS
console or any other tool of your choice to create the wildcard
record:

```
HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?"HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing"} --query 'HostedZone.Name' --output text)
INGRESS_DOMAIN="seed-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}"
# Get LB IP address from `kubectl -n kube-system get svc shared-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller`
LB_IP=$(kubectl -n kube-system get svc nginx-ingress-controller --template '{{(index .status.loadBalancer.ingress 0).ip}}')
awless create record \
  zone=$HOSTED_ZONE_ID \
  name="*.$INGRESS_DOMAIN" \
  value=$LB_IP \
  type=A \
  ttl=300
```

## Create Azure Service Principle to get Azure credentials

We need `client_id` and `client_secret` to allow Gardener to reach
Azure services, we can generate a pair by creating a Service Principle
on Azure:

```
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor"
Retrying role assignment creation: 1/36
{
  "appId": "xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx",     #az_client_id
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2018-05-23-16-15-49",
  "password": "xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx",  #az_client_secret
  "tenant": "xxxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxx"     #az_tenant_id
}
```

Let's define some env varibles for later use

```
CLIENT_ID=       # place your Azure Service Principal appId
CLIENT_SECRET=   # place your Azure Service Principal password here
```

## Install gardenctl

In this example we'll be using `gardenctl` to interact with
Gardener. You can install `gardenctl` following instruction in its
repo: https://github.com/gardener/gardenctl

Here is a simple configuration for gardenctl:

```
$ cat ~/.garden/config
gardenClusters:
- name: dev
  kubeConfig: ~/.kube/config
```

# Install Gardener

## Create garden namespace

This is where we deploy Gardener components.

```
kubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden.yaml
```

## Deploy etcd

Since Gardener is an extension API Server, it can share the etcd
backing native Kubernetes cluster's API Server, and hence explicit etcd
installation is optional. But in our case we have no access to the
control plane components of the AKS cluster and we have to deploy our
own etcd ourselves for Gardener.

The [`example/aks/etcd.yaml`](../../example/aks/etcd.yaml) file used
here is a modified version of the etcd manifest used in
[hack/dev-setup](../../hack/dev-setup) script to stay close to dev
setup. This one deploys an etcd with its data in a `PVC` rather than a
`hostPath` to provide persistency even when its POD jumps between
different hosts.

**Note**: This etcd installation doesn't provide HA. But etcd will be
auto recovered by the Deployment. This could be sufficient for some
deployments but may not be suitable for production usage. Also note
that this etcd is not deployed with TLS enabled and doesn't use
certificates for authentication.

```
kubectl apply -f example/aks/etcd.yaml
```

Check etcd logs and its started suceesfully:

```
kubectl -n garden get deploy,svc etcd
kubectl -n garden logs deployment/etcd
```

## Deploy Gardener Helm Chart

You need to update these Route53 related fields in the
[`example/aks/gardener-values.yaml`](../../example/aks/gardener-values.yaml)
since garden-controller-manager is the components that creates DNS
records in Route53:
* **controller.internalDomain.hostedZoneID**
* **controller.internalDomain.domain**: Here pick a subdomain for your
  Gardener to maintain DNS records for your Shoot clusters. This domain has
  to be within your Route53 Hosted Zone. e.g. `garden-1.your.domain.here`
* **controller.internalDomain.credentials**
* **controller.internalDomain.secretAccessKey**

```
HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?"HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing"} --query 'HostedZone.Name' --output text)
GARDENER_DOMAIN="garden-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}"
ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id)
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key)
sed -i \
  -e "s/hostedZoneID: Z3K\*\*\*/hostedZoneID: $HOSTED_ZONE_ID/" \
  -e "s/domain: subdomain.matching.domain.in.hoztedzone.id/domain: $GARDENER_DOMAIN/" \
  -e "s@accessKeyID: access_key_id@accessKeyID: $ACCESS_KEY_ID@" \
  -e "s@secretAccessKey: secret_access_key@secretAccessKey: $SECRET_ACCESS_KEY@" \
  example/aks/gardener-values.yaml
```

After updating these fields in the file, run:

```
helm upgrade --install --namespace garden garden charts/gardener -f example/aks/gardener-values.yaml
```

Validate the Gardener is deployed:

```
helm status garden  # Wait for `STATUS: DEPLOYED`

kubectl -n garden get deploy,pod -l app=gardener

# Better if you leave two terminals open in for below commands, and
# keep an eye on whats going on behind the scenes as you create/delete
# Gardener specific resources (Seed, CloudProfile, SecretBinding, Shoot).
kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-apiserver           # confirm no issues
kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-controller-manager  # confirm no issues, except some "Failed to list *v1beta1..." messages
```

**Note**: This is not meant to be used in production. You may not want
to use `apiserver.insecureSkipTLSVerify=true`, the hardcoded apiserver
certificates, and insecure (non-tls enabled) etcd. But for the sake of
keeping this example simple you can just keep those values as they
are.

# Create a CloudProfile

We need to create a CloudProfile to be referred from the Shoot
([`example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml`](../../example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml)):

```
kubectl apply -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml
```

Validate that CloudProfile is created:

```
kubectl describe -f example/30-cloudprofile-azure.yaml
```

# Define Seed cluster in Gardener

In our setup we'll use the cluster for Gardener also as a Seed, this
saves us from creating a new Kubernetes cluster. But you can also
create an explicit cluster for the Seed. Seed cluster can also be
placed into any other cloud provider or on prem. But keep in mind that
below steps may differ if you use a different cluster for seed.

Currently, a Seed cluster is just a Kubeconfig for the Gardener. The
seed cluster could have been created by any tool, Gardener only cares
about having a valid Kubeconfig to talk to its API.

## Create the Seed resource definition with its Secret

Lets start with the required seed secret first. Here we need to
provide it's cloud provider credentials and kubeconfig in the seed
secret. Update
[`example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml`](../../example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml)
and place the secrets for your environment:
* **data.subscriptionID**: you can learn this one with `az account show`
* **data.tenantID**: from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output as you can see above
* **data.clientID**: from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output as you can see above
* **data.clientSecret**: from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output as you can see above
* **data.kubeconfig**: you can get this one with `az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 -f - | base64`)

**Note**: All of the above values must be base64 encoded. If you skip this it will hurt you later.

```
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account list -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.isDefault == true) | .id')
TENANT_ID=$(az account show -o tsv --query 'tenantId')
KUBECONFIG_FOR_SEED_CLUSTER=$(az aks get-credentials --resource-group garden-1 --name garden-1 -f -)
sed -i \
  -e "s@base64(subscription-id)@$(echo $SUBSCRIPTION_ID | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(tenant-id)@$(echo "$TENANT_ID" | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(client-id)@$(echo "${CLIENT_ID:?"CLIENT_ID is missing"}" | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(client-secret)@$(echo "${CLIENT_SECRET:?"CLIENT_SECRET is missing"}" | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(kubeconfig-for-seed-cluster)@$(echo "$KUBECONFIG_FOR_SEED_CLUSTER" | base64)@" \
  example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml
```

After updating the fields, create the Seed secret:
```
kubectl apply -f example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml
```

Before creating Seed, we need to update the
[`example/50-seed-azure.yaml`](../../example/50-seed-azure.yaml) file and
update:
* **spec.networks**: IP ranges used in your AKS cluster.
* **spec.ingressDomain**: Place here the wildcard domain you have for
  the ingress controller (we created this record in prerequisites).
  Gardener doesn't create this DNS records but assumes its created
  ahead of time, Seed clusters are not provisioned by Gardener.
* **spec.cloud.region**: `eastus` (the region of the existing AKS cluster)

```
HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?"HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing"} --query 'HostedZone.Name' --output text)
INGRESS_DOMAIN="seed-1.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}"
# discover AKS CIDRs
NODE_CIDR=$(az network vnet list -g MC_garden-1_garden-1_eastus -o json | jq -r '.[] | .subnets[] | .addressPrefix')
POD_CIDR=$(kubectl -n kube-system get daemonset/kube-proxy -o yaml | grep cluster-cidr= | grep -v annotations | cut -d = -f2)
SERVICE_CIDR=10.0.0.0/16  # This one is hardcoded for now, not easy to discover
sed -i \
  -e "s/ingressDomain: dev.azure.seed.example.com/ingressDomain: $INGRESS_DOMAIN/" \
  -e "s/region: westeurope/region: eastus/" \
  -e "s@nodes: 10.240.0.0/16@nodes: $NODE_CIDR@" \
  -e "s@pods: 10.241.128.0/17@pods: $POD_CIDR@" \
  -e "s@services: 10.241.0.0/17@services: $SERVICE_CIDR@" \
  example/50-seed-azure.yaml
```

Now we are ready to create the seed:
```
kubectl apply -f example/50-seed-azure.yaml
```

Check the logs in gardener-controller-manager and also wait for seed
to be `Ready: True`. This means gardener-controller-manager is able to
reach the Seed cluster with the credentials you provide.

```
$ kubectl get seed azure
NAME      DOMAIN                      CLOUDPROFILE   REGION    READY
azure     seed-1.your.domain.here     azure          azure     True
$ gardenctl target garden dev
KUBECONFIG=/Users/user/.kube/config
$ gardenctl ls seeds
seeds:
- seed: azure
```

If something goes wrong verify that you provided right credentials,
and base64 encoded strings of those in the secret. Also check the
status field in the Seed resource and gardener-controller-manager
logs:

```
$ kubectl get seed azure -o json | jq .status
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "lastTransitionTime": "2018-05-31T14:56:49Z",
      "message": "all checks passed",
      "reason": "Passed",
      "status": "True",
      "type": "Available"
    }
  ]
}
```

# Create a Shoot cluster

## Create a Project (namespace) for Shoots

In this step we create a namespace in Gardener cluster to keep Shoot
resource definitions. A `project` in Gardener terminology is simply a
namespace that holds group of Shoots, during this example we'll deploy
a single Shoot. (Mind the extra labels defined in
[example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml](../../example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml)).

```
kubectl apply -f example/00-namespace-garden-dev.yaml
```

You can check the projects via `gardenctl`:

```
$ gardenctl target garden dev
$ gardenctl ls projects
projects:
- project: garden-dev
```

## Create a SecretBinding and related Secret

We'll use same Azure credentials with
[`example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml`](../../example/40-secret-seed-azure.yaml),
this is due to the fact that we use the same Azure Subscription for
the Shoot and Seed clusters. Differently from the Seed secret, in this
one we don't need to provide `kubeconfig` since the Shoot cluster will
be provisioned by Gardener, and we need to provide credentials for
Route53 DNS records management.

Update
[`example/70-secret-cloudprovider-azure.yaml`](../../example/70-secret-cloudprovider-azure.yaml)
and place the secrets for your environment:
* **data.subscriptionID**: you can learn this one with `az account show`
* **data.tenantID**: from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output as you can see above
* **data.clientID**: from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output as you can see above
* **data.clientSecret**: from `az ad sp create-for-rbac` output as you can see above
* **data.accessKeyID**: You need to add this field for Route53 records to be updated.
* **data.secretAccessKey**: You need to add this field for Route53 records to be updated.

**Note**: All of the above values must be base64 encoded. If you skip this it will hurt you later.

```
SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account list -o json | jq -r '.[] | select(.isDefault == true) | .id')
TENANT_ID=$(az account show -o tsv --query 'tenantId')
ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(aws configure get aws_access_key_id)
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(aws configure get aws_secret_access_key)
sed -i \
  -e "s@base64(subscription-id)@$(echo $SUBSCRIPTION_ID | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(tenant-id)@$(echo "$TENANT_ID" | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(client-id)@$(echo "${CLIENT_ID:?"CLIENT_ID is missing"}" | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "s@base64(client-secret)@$(echo "${CLIENT_SECRET:?"CLIENT_SECRET is missing"}" | tr -d '\n' | base64)@" \
  -e "\$a\ \ accessKeyID: $(echo $ACCESS_KEY_ID | tr -d '\n' | base64 )" \
  -e "\$a\ \ secretAccessKey: $(echo $SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | tr -d '\n' | base64 )" \
  example/70-secret-cloudprovider-azure.yaml
```

After updating the fields, create the cloud provider secret:

```
kubectl apply -f example/70-secret-cloudprovider-azure.yaml
```

And create the SecretBinding resource to allow Gardener use that
secret
([`example/80-secretbinding-cloudprovider-azure.yaml`](../../example/80-secretbinding-cloudprovider-azure.yaml)):

```
sed -i \
  -e 's/# namespace: .*/  namespace: garden-dev/' \
  example/80-secretbinding-cloudprovider-azure.yaml
kubectl apply -f example/80-secretbinding-cloudprovider-azure.yaml
```

Check the logs in gardener-controller-manager, there should not be any
problems reported.

## Create the Shoot resource

Update the fields in [`example/90-shoot-azure.yaml`](../../example/90-shoot-azure.yaml):
* **spec.cloud.region**: `eastus` (this must match the seed cluster's region)
* **spec.dns.domain**: This is used to specify the base domain for
  your api (and other in the future) endpoint(s). For example when
  `johndoe-azure.garden-dev.your.domain.here` is used as a value, then your
  apiserver is available at `api.johndoe-azure.garden-dev.your.domain.here`
* **spec.dns.hostedZoneID**: This field doesn't exist in the example
  you need to add this field and place the Route53 Hosted Zone ID.
* **spec.addons.kube-lego.email**: This is the email address used when
  using kube-lego. See
  [kube-lego Environment Variables](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego#environment-variables)

```
HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN=$(aws route53 get-hosted-zone --id /hostedzone/${HOSTED_ZONE_ID:?"HOSTED_ZONE_ID is missing"} --query 'HostedZone.Name' --output text)
SHOOT_DOMAIN="johndoe-azure.garden-dev.${HOSTED_ZONE_DOMAIN%%.}"
KUBE_LEGO_EMAIL=$(git config user.email)
sed -i \
  -e "s/region: westeurope/region: eastus/" \
  -e "s/domain: johndoe-azure.garden-dev.example.com/domain: $SHOOT_DOMAIN/" \
  -e "/domain:/a\ \ \ \ hostedZoneID: $HOSTED_ZONE_ID" \
  -e "s/email: john.doe@example.com/email: $KUBE_LEGO_EMAIL/" \
  example/90-shoot-azure.yaml
```

And let's create the Shoot resource:
```
kubectl apply -f example/90-shoot-azure.yaml
```

After creating the Shoot resource, gardener-controller-manager will
pick it up and start provisioning the Shoot cluster.

Follow the logs in your console with gardener-controller-manager,
starting like below you'll see plenty of `Waiting` and `Executing`,
etc. logs and many tasks will keep repeating:

At this stage you should be waiting for a while until the Shoot
cluster is provisioned and initial resources are deployed.

During the provisioning you can also check output of these commands to
have a better understanding about what's going on in the seed cluster:

```
$ gardenctl ls shoots

Check Shoot cluster:

```
$ gardenctl target garden dev
KUBECONFIG=/Users/user/.kube/config
$ gardenctl target project garden-dev
$ gardenctl target shoot johndoe-azure
KUBECONFIG=/Users/user/.garden/cache/projects/garden-dev/johndoe-azure/kubeconfig.yaml
$ gardenctl kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://api.johndoe-azure.garden-dev.your.domain.here
KubeDNS is running at https://api.johndoe-azure.garden-dev.your.domain.here/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
kubernetes-dashboard is running at https://api.johndoe-azure.garden-dev.your.domain.here/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

### Cluster Resources After Shoot is Created

After the Shoot has been created the summary of the resources in the
AKS cluster handled by Gardener will be something like this:

```
non-namespaced resources
  CloudProfile: azure
  Seed: azure  # cloud.profile:azure, cloud.region:eastus, secretRef.name:seed-azure, secretRef.namespace: garden

Namespace: garden
  Secret: seed-azure  # aks credentials, kubeconfig
  # No other resources with any kind handled by Gardener
  # Gardener components as well lives in this namespace

Namespace: garden-dev  # maps to "project:dev" in Gardener
  Secret: core-azure         # credentials for aks + aws (for route53)
  SecretBinding: core-azure  # secretRef.name:core-azure
  Shoot: johndoe-azure       # seed:azure, secretBindingRef.name:core-azure

Namespace: shoot--dev--johndoe-azure
  # These are automatically created once Shoot resource is created
  AzureMachineClass: shoot--dev--johndoe-azure-cpu-worker-8506a
  MachineDeployment: shoot--dev--johndoe-azure-cpu-worker
  MachineSet: shoot--dev--johndoe-azure-cpu-worker-849bbbf75
  Machine: shoot--dev--johndoe-azure-cpu-worker-849bbbf75-b42vh
  BackupInfra: shoot--dev--johndoe-azure--c1b3b  # seed:azure, shootUID: shoot.status.UID.
  # Many other resources created as part of shoot cluster,
  #   but only above ones are handled by Gardener

Namespace: backup--shoot--dev--johndoe-azure--c1b3b
  # Secrets and configMap having info related to backup infrastructure
  #   are created by Gardener.
```

### Troubleshooting Shoot Creation Issues

For any issue happening during Shoot provisioning, you can consult the
gardener-controller-manager logs, or the state in the shoot resource,
`gardenctl` also provides a command to check Shoot cluster states:

```
# check gardener-controller-manager logs
kubectl -n garden logs -f deployment/gardener-controller-manager
# kubectl describe can provide you a human readable output of
# same information in below gardenctl command.
kubectl -n garden-dev describe shoot johndoe-azure
# also try cheking the machine-controller-manager logs of the shoot
kubectl logs -n shoot--dev--johndoe-azure deployment/machine-controller-manager
```

With `gardenctl`:

```
$ gardenctl ls issues
issues:
- project: garden-dev
  seed: azure
  shoot:
  health: Ready
  status: johndoe-azure
    lastError: "Failed to reconcile Shoot cluster state: Errors occurred during flow
      execution: '(*Botanist).DeployExternalDomainDNSRecord' returned 'Terraform execution
	  ...
    lastOperation:
      description: "Failed to reconcile Shoot cluster state: Errors occurred during
        flow execution: '(*Botanist).DeployExternalDomainDNSRecord' returned 'Terraform
		...
      lastUpdateTime: 2018-06-03 09:48:00 +0100 IST
      progress: 100
      state: Failed
      type: Reconcile
```

# Access Shoot cluster

The `gardenctl` tool provides a convenient wrapper to operate on both
cluster and cloud providers, here are some commands you can run

```
# select target shoot cluster
gardenctl ls gardens
gardenctl target garden dev
gardenctl ls projects
gardenctl target shoot johndoe-azure

# issue Azure client (az) commands on target shoot
gardenctl az aks list

# issue kubectl commands on target shoot
gardenctl kubectl -- version --short  # '--' is required if you want to
                                      # pass any args starting with '-'

# open prometheus, alertmanager, grafana without having to find
# the user/pass for each
gardenctl show prometheus
gardenctl show grafana
gardenctl show alertmanager
```

Easiest way to obtain `kubeconfig` of the shoot cluster:

```
$ gardenctl target shoot johndoe-azure
KUBECONFIG=/Users/user/.garden/cache/projects/garden-dev/johndoe-azure/kubeconfig.yaml
$ export KUBECONFIG=/Users/user/.garden/cache/projects/garden-dev/johndoe-azure/kubeconfig.yaml
$                        # From now on your local kubectl will be operating on target shoot
$ kubectl cluster-info   # will show your shoot cluster info
$ unset KUBECONFIG       # reset to your default kubectl
```

The shoot cluster's kubeconfig is being kept in a secret in the
project namespace:

```
kubectl -n shoot--dev--johndoe-azure get secret kubecfg -o jsonpath='{.data.kubeconfig}' | base64 -D > /tmp/johndoe-azure-kubeconfig.yaml
export KUBECONFIG=/tmp/johndoe-azure-kubeconfig.yaml
```

# Delete Shoot cluster

Deleting a Shoot cluster is not straight forward, and this is to
protect users from undesired/accidental cluster deletion. One has to
place some special annotations to get a Shoot cluster removed. We use
the [hack/delete-shoot](../../hack/delete-shoot) for this purpose.

Please refer to [Creating / Deleting a Shoot
cluster](../usage/shoots.md) document for more details.
